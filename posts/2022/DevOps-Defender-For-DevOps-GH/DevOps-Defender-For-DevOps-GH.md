### Microsoft Security DevOps (MSDO) GitHub action

**Microsoft Security DevOps** (MSDO) is a command line application which integrates **static analysis tools**, for **security** and **compliance** into the development cycle.

Today we will take a closer look at how we can use the [MSDO GitHub action](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/github-action?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5004771) and how it integrates with [Microsoft Defender for DevOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-devops-introduction?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5004771).

MSDO installs, configures and runs the latest versions of **static analysis tools**. It is data-driven with portable configurations that enable deterministic execution across multiple environments.

The MSDO toolkit can output and convert results to [Static Analysis Results Interchange Format (SARIF)](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/sarif-support-for-code-scanning) which can display the results in your **repository** on **GitHub**.

MSDO integrates with [Microsoft Defender for DevOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-devops-introduction?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5004771) which enables a central console as part of [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5004771) to provide security teams **DevOps insights** across multi-pipeline environments, such as **GitHub** and **Azure DevOps**.

These insights can then be correlated with other contextual cloud security intelligence to prioritise remediation in code and apply consistent security guardrails throughout the application lifecycle. The benefits of **Defender for DevOps**, available through **Defender for Cloud** are:

- Unified visibility into DevOps security posture.
- Visibility of rich security insights to help strengthen cloud resource configurations throughout the development lifecycle.
- Prioritise remediation of critical issues in code.

### Getting started

Before we dive into the MSDO toolkit we first need to connect our GitHub repository to [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/quickstart-onboard-github?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5004771).

1. Log into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2. Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Environment Settings**.

3. Select **Add environment** and then Select **GitHub**. ![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022/DevOps-Defender-For-DevOps-GH/assets/dfc01.png)

4. Enter a **name**, select your **subscription**, **resource group**, and **region**. ![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022/DevOps-Defender-For-DevOps-GH/assets/dfc02.png)

5. **Select Plans**. ![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022/DevOps-Defender-For-DevOps-GH/assets/dfc03.png)

6. Select **Next: Authorize connection** and **Authorize** the **GitHub** connection after reviewing the permission request. ![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022/DevOps-Defender-For-DevOps-GH/assets/dfc04.png)

7. After **Authorizing** click on **Install** under **Install Defender for DevOps app**. ![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022/DevOps-Defender-For-DevOps-GH/assets/dfc05.png)

8. You can install the **Defender for DevOps** app on **All** or **Individual** repositories as necessary. ![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022/DevOps-Defender-For-DevOps-GH/assets/dfc06.png)

9. Select **Next: Review and create**. Review the information and select **Create**.

**NOTES:** You will see the **GitHub** connector under **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Environment Settings**. If you only added one repository and wanted to later change and add/onboard more repositories onto the same **Defender for DevOps** plan, you can do so by navigating to your **GitHub Settings > Applications**.

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022/DevOps-Defender-For-DevOps-GH/assets/dfc07.png)

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022/DevOps-Defender-For-DevOps-GH/assets/dfc08.png)

After installing **Defender for DevOps** on the selected repositories you want to onboard, they will be integrated with **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** and insights will be accessible from the **DevOps Security** dashboard under **Defender for Cloud** in the **Azure portal**.

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022/DevOps-Defender-For-DevOps-GH/assets/dfc09.png)

Next we will look at the **MSDO GitHub action** and see how we can use certain tools and populate the dashboard with rich security insights about our code.

### Configuring the MSDO GitHub action (Terrascan)

The following examples can also be found on my [MSDO-Lab GitHub page](https://github.com/Pwd9000-ML/MSDO-Lab).

As mentioned MSDO features a few different tools (I will cover some of the other tools in a future blog post), but I want to concentrate on a specific tool today called [Terrascan](https://github.com/accurics/terrascan).

**Terrascan** is a static code analyzer for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Let's take a look at an example on how we can use **MSDO** integration with **Defender for DevOps** to get security insights and detect compliance and security violations in a **Terraform** configuration to mitigate risk before provisioning cloud infrastructure.

On my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Pwd9000-ML/MSDO-Lab) under the path [01_Foundation](https://github.com/Pwd9000-ML/MSDO-Lab/tree/master/01_Foundation) I have the following terraform configuration that simply builds a **Resource Group** and a **Key Vault**.

```hcl
### Data Sources ###
data "azurerm_client_config" "current" {}

#Create a Resource Group
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
  name     = var.resource_group_name
  location = var.location
  tags     = var.tags
}

#Create a Key Vault for the Resource Group
resource "azurerm_key_vault" "kv" {
  name                        = "${lower(var.key_vault_name)}${random_integer.kv_num.result}"
  location                    = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
  resource_group_name         = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  enable_rbac_authorization   = var.use_rbac_mode
  enabled_for_disk_encryption = true
  tenant_id                   = data.azurerm_client_config.current.tenant_id
  soft_delete_retention_days  = 7
  purge_protection_enabled    = false
  sku_name                    = "standard"
  tags                        = var.tags
}

resource "random_integer" "kv_num" {
  min = 0001
  max = 9999
}
```

Let's take a look at how we can use **Terrascan** using the **[MSDO GitHub action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/security-devops-action)** to scan our terraform code.

1. Sign in to [GitHub](https://www.github.com/) and select a repository you added earlier to **Defender for DevOps** on which you want to configure the **MSDO GitHub action**.

2. Select **Actions > set up a workflow yourself** ![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022/DevOps-Defender-For-DevOps-GH/assets/action01.png)

3. Give the workflow file a name. For example, `msdevopssec.yml`. ![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022/DevOps-Defender-For-DevOps-GH/assets/action02.png)

4. Copy and paste the following [sample action workflow](https://github.com/Pwd9000-ML/MSDO-Lab/blob/master/.github/workflows/msdevopssec.yml) into the **Edit new file** tab.

```yml
# My Microsoft Security DevOps (MSDO) Terrascan workflow
name: MSDO windows-latest
on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  MSDO:
    # MSDO runs on windows-latest and ubuntu-latest.
    # macos-latest supporting coming soon
    runs-on: windows-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Run MSDO analyzers
      - name: Run Microsoft Security DevOps Analysis
        uses: microsoft/security-devops-action@preview
        id: msdo
        env:
          terrascan_scan: 'scan'
          terrascan_outputtype: 'sarif'
          terrascan_iacdir: '01_Foundation'

      # Upload alerts to the Security tab
      - name: Upload alerts to Security tab
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v1
        with:
          sarif_file: ${{ steps.msdo.outputs.sarifFile }}
```

After creating the workflow you can run it manually under the **Actions** tab:

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022/DevOps-Defender-For-DevOps-GH/assets/run01.png)

After running the workflow you can review the steps and note that the MSDO toolkit is installed and runs **Terrascan** against the path we specified in the action step which was **01_Foundation** that contains the terraform IaC configurations.

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022/DevOps-Defender-For-DevOps-GH/assets/run02.png)

Let's take a closer look at the MSDO GitHub action being used:

```yml
# Run MSDO analyzers
- name: Run Microsoft Security DevOps Analysis
uses: microsoft/security-devops-action@preview
id: msdo
env:
    terrascan_scan: 'scan'
    terrascan_outputtype: 'sarif'
    terrascan_iacdir: '01_Foundation'
```

### How to configure different MSDO analyzers

There are a few ways configure tool inputs:

1. Creating a `*.gdnconfig` file to save configurations.

   - Great for reuse between team members and local/remote runs.
   - Can save multiple tool configurations in a single file to run all configurations.

2. Using environment variables
   - Great for quick configurations in build pipelines.
   - They follow the format `[GDN_]<ToolName>_<ArgumentId>`, where `GDN_` is optional and ToolName`and`ArgumentId` are defined by the tool integration file to (\*.gdntool).

As you can see I have specified the tool/**(Terrascan)** inputs as environment variables on the action itself e.g.

```yml
steps:
  - uses: microsoft/security-devops-action
    env:
      <key>: '<value>'
```

You can see all tools as part of MSDO inputs / environment variables on the following [Wiki Documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/security-devops-action/wiki#table-of-contents)

### Terrascan options

### Defender for DevOps Dashboard

As mentioned before MSDO closely integrates with **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** and has its own dashboard **Defender or DevOps** to review and get security insights into the code.

In the Azure portal navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**, select the **DevOps Security** pane and then click on the GitHub connector:

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022/DevOps-Defender-For-DevOps-GH/assets/msdo01.png)

Notice that I have some **Unhealthy** recommendations and need to resolve infrastructure as code scanning issues:

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022/DevOps-Defender-For-DevOps-GH/assets/msdo02.png)

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022/DevOps-Defender-For-DevOps-GH/assets/msdo05.png)

Let's navigate back to the **GitHub repository**, select the **security tab** and **Code Scanning**:

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022/DevOps-Defender-For-DevOps-GH/assets/msdo03.png)

Because we selected the output format to be **SARIF** and used another action in our workflow; `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v1` to upload the **SARIF** file we can now see the MSDO Terrascan results and issues that needs to be resolved directly from the repository Security tab:

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022/DevOps-Defender-For-DevOps-GH/assets/msdo04.png)

### Code scanning severities

You can also define code scanning severities which should cause a **pull request check** to **fail** to prevent security issues from being commited into your code by accident.

This can be configured under the **GitHub repository Settings > Code security and analysis**:

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022/DevOps-Defender-For-DevOps-GH/assets/sev01.png)

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022/DevOps-Defender-For-DevOps-GH/assets/sev02.png)

Once the **IaC** security findings are resolved you will notice that the status of the recommendation has changed from **Unhealthy** to **Healthy**:

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022/DevOps-Defender-For-DevOps-GH/assets/sev03.png)

Stay tuned for my next blog post where we will use MSDO in **Azure DevOps repositories** instead of GitHub and use the **Azure DevOps MSDO Marketplace extension** instead of the MSDO GitHub action.  

I hope you have enjoyed this post and have learned something new. You can find the code samples used in this blog post on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Pwd9000-ML/MSDO-Lab) page. :heart:
