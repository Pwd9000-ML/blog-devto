## Overview

Welcome to another part of my series **['GitHub Codespaces Pro Tips'](https://dev.to/pwd9000/series/19195)**. In the last part we spoke about integrating **GitHub** with **Azure DevOps** and how you can use some of the great features of GitHub, like **Codespaces** along with Azure DevOps.

In todays post I will share with you how you can use your **GitHub Codespace** not only as a "development environment" for working with your code, but also utilising the **Codespace** compute power, by running a **Self Hosted GitHub runner** inside of the Codespace at the same time.

We will be using a custom **docker image** that will automatically provision a **self hosted runner agent** and register it at the same time as provisioning the **Codespace** as part of the development environment.

We will also look at the **Codespace/Runner** lifecycle. By default any **Active** codespaces that becomes **idle** will go into a hibernation mode after **30 minutes** to save on compute costs, so we will look at how this timeout can be configured and extended (if needed).  

We will actually be using a very similar approach for the docker image configuration based on one of my previous blog posts, ['Create a Docker based Self Hosted GitHub runner Linux container'](https://dev.to/pwd9000/create-a-docker-based-self-hosted-github-runner-linux-container-48dh). So do check out that post also if you wanted more info on how **self hosted GitHub runner** containers work.  

## Getting started

All of the code samples and examples are also available on my [GitHub Codespaces Demo Repository](https://github.com/Pwd9000-ML/GitHub-Codespaces-Lab/tree/master/.devcontainer/codespaceRunner).

Since **Codespaces/Dev containers** are based on **docker images**, we will create a **custom linux docker image** that will start and bootstrap a runner agent as the codespace starts up.  

We will create the following folder structure tree in the [root](https://github.com/Pwd9000-ML/GitHub-Codespaces-Lab/tree/master/.devcontainer/codespaceRunner) of our **GitHub repository:**  

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022-GitHub-Codespaces-runner/assets/root01.png)

In your **GitHub repository** create a sub folder under `'.devcontainer'`, in my case I have called my codespace configuration folder `'codepsaceRunner'`.

Next create the following [Dockerfile](https://github.com/Pwd9000-ML/GitHub-Codespaces-Lab/blob/master/.devcontainer/codespaceRunner/Dockerfile):

```dockerfile
# You can pick any Debian/Ubuntu-based image. ðŸ˜Š
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/base:0-bullseye

# [Optional] Install zsh
ARG INSTALL_ZSH="true"
# [Optional] Upgrade OS packages to their latest versions
ARG UPGRADE_PACKAGES="false"

# Install needed packages and setup non-root user. Use a separate RUN statement to add your own dependencies.
ARG USERNAME=vscode
ARG USER_UID=1000
ARG USER_GID=$USER_UID
COPY library-scripts/*.sh /tmp/library-scripts/
RUN bash /tmp/library-scripts/common-debian.sh "${INSTALL_ZSH}" "${USERNAME}" "${USER_UID}" "${USER_GID}" "${UPGRADE_PACKAGES}" "true" "true"

# cd into the user directory, download and unzip the github actions runner
RUN cd /home/vscode && mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner

#input GitHub runner version argument
ARG RUNNER_VERSION="2.292.0"

RUN cd /home/vscode/actions-runner \
    && curl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v${RUNNER_VERSION}/actions-runner-linux-x64-${RUNNER_VERSION}.tar.gz \
    && tar xzf /home/vscode/actions-runner/actions-runner-linux-x64-${RUNNER_VERSION}.tar.gz \
    && /home/vscode/actions-runner/bin/installdependencies.sh

# add over the start.sh script
COPY library-scripts/start.sh /home/vscode/actions-runner/start.sh

# Aply ownership of home folder
RUN chown -R vscode ~vscode

# make the script executable
RUN chmod +x /home/vscode/actions-runner/start.sh

# Clean up
RUN rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/library-scripts
```

Then create a `'devcontainer.json'` file. (See my [previous blog post](https://dev.to/pwd9000/introduction-to-github-codespaces-building-your-first-dev-container-69l) on how this file can be amended with additional features and extensions):  

```JSON
{
	"name": "CodespaceRunner",
	"dockerFile": "Dockerfile",
	
	// Configure tool-specific properties.
	"customizations": {
		// Configure properties specific to VS Code.
		"vscode": {		
			// Add the IDs of extensions you want installed when the container is created.
			"extensions": [
				"ms-vscode.azurecli",
				"ms-vscode.powershell",
				"hashicorp.terraform",
				"esbenp.prettier-vscode",
				"tfsec.tfsec"
			]
		}
	},
	
	// Use 'forwardPorts' to make a list of ports inside the container available locally.
	// "forwardPorts": [],

	// Use 'postStartCommand' to run commands each time the container is successfully started..
    "postStartCommand": "/home/vscode/actions-runner/start.sh",

	// Comment out to connect as root instead. More info: https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/non-root.
	"remoteUser": "vscode",
	"build": {
		"args": {
			"UPGRADE_PACKAGES": "true",
			"RUNNER_VERSION": "2.295.0"
		}
	},
	"features": {
		"terraform": "latest",
		"azure-cli": "latest",
		"git-lfs": "latest",
		"github-cli": "latest",
		"powershell": "latest"
	}
}
```

Next we will create a few scripts that will be used by our **docker image**. Create a folder called `'library-scripts'` and place the following two script inside: ['start.sh'](https://github.com/Pwd9000-ML/GitHub-Codespaces-Lab/blob/master/.devcontainer/codespaceRunner/scripts/start.sh) and ['common-debian.sh'](https://github.com/Pwd9000-ML/GitHub-Codespaces-Lab/blob/master/.devcontainer/codespaceRunner/library-scripts/common-debian.sh)  

Let's take a closer look at each of the scripts.  

1. **[common-debian.sh](https://github.com/Pwd9000-ML/GitHub-Codespaces-Lab/blob/master/.devcontainer/codespaceRunner/library-scripts/common-debian.sh)**  This script will install additional **debian** based tooling onto the **dev container**.  

2. **[start.sh](https://github.com/Pwd9000-ML/GitHub-Codespaces-Lab/blob/master/.devcontainer/codespaceRunner/scripts/start.sh)**  

```bash
#start.sh
#!/bin/bash

GH_OWNER=$GH_OWNER
GH_REPOSITORY=$GH_REPOSITORY
GH_TOKEN=$GH_TOKEN

HOSTNAME=$(hostname)
RUNNER_SUFFIX="runner"
RUNNER_NAME="${HOSTNAME}-${RUNNER_SUFFIX}"
USER_NAME_LABEL=$(git config --get user.name)
REPO_NAME_LABEL=$(basename `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`)

REG_TOKEN=$(curl -sX POST -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" -H "Authorization: token ${GH_TOKEN}" https://api.github.com/repos/${GH_OWNER}/${GH_REPOSITORY}/actions/runners/registration-token | jq .token --raw-output)

/home/vscode/actions-runner/config.sh --unattended --url https://github.com/${GH_OWNER}/${GH_REPOSITORY} --token ${REG_TOKEN} --name ${RUNNER_NAME}  --labels ${USER_NAME_LABEL},${REPO_NAME_LABEL}

cleanup() {
    echo "Removing runner..."
    /home/vscode/actions-runner/config.sh remove --unattended --token ${REG_TOKEN}
}

trap 'cleanup; exit 130' INT
trap 'cleanup; exit 143' TERM
trap 'cleanup' SIGINT SIGTERM

/home/vscode/actions-runner/run.sh & wait $!
```

The second script will start up with the **Codespace/Dev container** started and bootstraps the **GitHub runner** when the Codespace starts. But you will notice that we need to provide the script some parameters:

```bash
GH_OWNER=$GH_OWNER
GH_REPOSITORY=$GH_REPOSITORY
GH_TOKEN=$GH_TOKEN
```

These parameters (environment variables) are used to configure and **register** the self hosted github runner against the correct repository.

We need to provide the GitHub account/org name via the `'GH_OWNER'` environment variable, repository name via `GH_REPOSITORY` and a PAT token with `GH_TOKEN`.

You can store sensitive information, like tokens, that you want to access in your codespaces via environment variables. Let's configure these parameters as encrypted [secrets for codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-your-codespaces/managing-encrypted-secrets-for-your-codespaces):

1. Navigate to the repository `'Settings'` page and select `'Secrets -> Codespaces'`, click on `'New repository secret'`. ![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022-GitHub-Codespaces-runner/assets/sec01.png)

2. Create each **Codespace secret** with the values for your environment. ![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022-GitHub-Codespaces-runner/assets/sec02.png)  

**NOTE:** When the **self hosted runner** is started up and registered, it will also be labeled with the **user name** and **repository name**, from the following lines. (These labels can be amended if necessary):

```bash
USER_NAME_LABEL=$(git config --get user.name)
REPO_NAME_LABEL=$(basename `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`)
```

## Note on Personal Access Token (PAT)

See [creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) on how to create a GitHub PAT token. PAT tokens are only displayed once and are sensitive, so ensure they are kept safe.

The minimum permission scopes required on the PAT token to register a self hosted runner are: `"repo"`, `"read:org"`:

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022-GitHub-Codespaces-runner/assets/PAT.png)

**Tip:** I recommend only using short lived PAT tokens and generating new tokens whenever new agent runner registrations are required.  

## Deploying the Codespace GitHub runner

As you can see in my example screenshot below, my repository does not have any runners configured.

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022-GitHub-Codespaces-runner/assets/run01.png)

1. Navigate to your repository, click on the `'<> Code'` dropdown and select the `'Codespaces'` tab, select the `'Advanced'` option to **Configure and create codespace**. ![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022-GitHub-Codespaces-runner/assets/run02.png)
