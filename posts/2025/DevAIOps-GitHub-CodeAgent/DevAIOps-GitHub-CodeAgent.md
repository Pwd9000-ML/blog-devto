## Practical Use Cases for DevOps Teams

### Infrastructure Automation

GitHub Copilot Code Agent excels at generating infrastructure automation scripts:

**Terraform Resource Generation**:

```hcl
# Copilot can suggest complete resource blocks
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "main" {
  name     = var.resource_group_name
  location = var.location

  tags = {
    Environment = var.environment
    Project     = var.project_name
  }
}
```

**Kubernetes Deployment Manifests**:

```yaml
# Automatically generated deployment configurations
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-application
  labels:
    app: web-application
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web-application
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web-application
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: web-application
          image: nginx:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Development

Streamline your continuous integration and deployment workflows:

**GitHub Actions Workflow**:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Azure
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Deploy to Azure
        uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
        with:
          app-name: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME }}
          publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
```

### Monitoring and Observability

Generate monitoring configurations and alerting rules:

**Prometheus Configuration**:

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'kubernetes-pods'
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: pod
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_scrape]
        action: keep
        regex: true
```

    """
    Deploy infrastructure using Terraform configuration.

    Args:
        config_file (str): Path to Terraform configuration file
        environment (str): Target deployment environment (dev, staging, prod)

    Returns:
        bool: True if deployment successful, False otherwise

    Raises:
        TerraformError: If Terraform execution fails
        ConfigurationError: If configuration file is invalid
    """
    # Implementation details...
```

### Test Generation

Automatically generate comprehensive test suites:

```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock

class TestInfrastructureDeployment(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.config_file = "test_config.tf"
        self.environment = "dev"

    @patch('subprocess.run')
    def test_successful_deployment(self, mock_subprocess):
        mock_subprocess.return_value.returncode = 0
        result = deploy_infrastructure(self.config_file, self.environment)
        self.assertTrue(result)

    def test_invalid_config_file(self):
        with self.assertRaises(ConfigurationError):
            deploy_infrastructure("nonexistent.tf", self.environment)
```
