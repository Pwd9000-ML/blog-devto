series: Terraform ERRORS!
---

Welcome to a new Terraform blog post series, **[Terraform ERRORS!]()** In this series, we will explore common errors and issues that you may encounter when working with Terraform and how to resolve them. In this series, we will focus mainly on **idempotency violations** and how to handle them when working with **Terraform** and **Microsoft Azure**. Let's dive in!

## Idempotency: The Backbone of Terraform

**Idempotency** is one of **Terraform's** most powerful features, ensuring that you can apply your **infrastructure code** multiple times and always get the same result. This consistency is essential for managing **Azure cloud resources** like **virtual machines**, **storage accounts**, **databases**, in addition **permissions and RBAC** and much more efficiently.

## Common Idempotency Violations using Terraform

When **idempotency breaks**, it can lead to issues such as **Duplicate Key/Entry Error**, **Resource Conflict Errors**, or **Already Exists Errors**. Understanding what idempotency means in **practical scenarios** and knowing how to resolve these failures is crucial for maintaining a **reliable Infrastructure as Code**.  

Let's look at a few common examples of **idempotency violations** when working with **Terraform** and **Microsoft Azure** and how to best handle them.

### 2. Resource Already Exists

**Scenario:** You try to create a resource in Azure, but it already exists (perhaps it was created outside of Terraform or during a previous run).

  ```hcl
  Error: A resource with the ID already exists - to be managed via Terraform this resource needs to be imported into the State.
  
    on main.tf line 1, in resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example":
      1: resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  
  The specified resource already exists in Azure. It must be imported to Terraform or deleted manually.
  ```

This is a more robust solution as it uses a `data` resource to check if the role assignment/s already exists before creating it. This way we can avoid the violation by creating the role assignment only when needed. This method is useful with `for_each` when you want to check and create role assignments conditionally and is a lot more flexible as it can be used with multiple user assigned identities or multiple role definitions, will skip permissions that already exist and only create the ones that do not exist yet.

```hcl
# Check if the role assignment already exists with 'for_each' on  'data' resource
data "azurerm_role_assignments" "rbac" {
  for_each = toset(["Contributor", "Reader"])
  principal_id = azurerm_user_assigned_identity.uai.principal_id
  role_definition_name = each.value
  scope = azurerm_resource_group.rg.id
}

# Only create role assignments for the role definitions that do not exist in the data resource check and skip the ones that already exist in the data resource check
resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "rbac" {
  for_each = toset(["Contributor", "Reader"])
  count = data.azurerm_role_assignments.rbac[each.value] == null ? 1 : 0
  principal_id = azurerm_user_assigned_identity.uai.principal_id
  role_definition_name = each.value
  scope = azurerm_resource_group.rg.id
}
```

## solution 4: Use `terraform_data` instead of `null_resource` to create the role assignment

### 3. Duplicate Resource Declaration

**Scenario:** You try to create a resource in Terraform that already exists in the state file.

  ```hcl
  Error: Resource already managed by Terraform
  
    on main.tf line 2, in resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example":
      2: resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  
  A resource with the ID is already defined in the Terraform state file. Remove duplicate declarations.
  ```

### 4. Resource Conflict

**Scenario:** You attempt to create or modify a resource, but the desired configuration conflicts with the existing resource settings that already exist in the provider.

  ```hcl
  Error: Conflict with existing settings.
  
    on main.tf line 2, in resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example":
      2: resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  
  The specified settings for the resource conflict with the existing configuration in Azure.
  ```

### 5. Immutable Resources or Properties

**Scenario:** "Immutable Resource Properties" or "Breaking Changes" in the context of Azure Resource Manager (ARM). These terms describe properties of Azure resources that cannot be modified directly and require recreating the resource to apply the change.

  ```hcl
    Error: Resource change requires replacement.
    
      on main.tf line 2, in resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example":
       2: resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
    
    The property `account_tier` cannot be updated in place. The resource must be replaced.
  ```

### 6. Provider level Errors

**Scenario:** Errors that occur at the provider level in Azure, such as authentication issues, network problems, rate limiting, resource locks, azure policy restrictions, etc.

  ```hcl
  Error: AuthorizationFailed
  
  The client 'your-client-id' does not have authorization to perform action 
  'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/write' over scope '/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}'.
  ```

  ```hcl
  Error: RequestDisallowedByPolicy
  
  The resource creation failed due to a policy compliance issue.
  Policy: Allowed locations does not allow resources in location 'West Europe'.
  Allowed values: ['East US'].
  ```

## Best Practices to Avoid Problems with Idempotency

1. **Import Existing Resources:** Add unmanaged resources to Terraform’s state before applying changes.
2. **Use Data Sources:** Query existing resources to make decisions in your code.
3. **Add Conditions:** Use `count` or `for_each` to create resources only when needed.
4. **Ignore Unimportant Changes:** Use lifecycle rules to avoid unnecessary updates.
5. **Limit Provisioners:** Only use provisioners for tasks Terraform can’t handle natively.
6. **Plan Before Apply:** Always run `terraform plan` before applying your configuration. This step helps you preview the changes Terraform will make, ensuring they align with your expectations. For beginners, planning is especially critical as it can catch common issues like misconfigurations or unintended resource changes before they happen. It’s a simple but powerful way to avoid surprises and maintain control over your infrastructure. Always run `terraform plan` to preview changes and catch potential issues early.
7. **Sync with Cloud State:** Use `terraform refresh` to update Terraform’s state before applying changes.

## Conclusion

Idempotency makes **Terraform** a reliable tool for managing cloud infrastructure. By understanding common problems and using the strategies in this blog, you can avoid errors and keep your infrastructure predictable. Whether you're working on Azure RBAC or other setups, these tips will help you write better Terraform configurations. With careful planning and good practices, you can ensure that Terraform runs smoothly and efficiently every time.
