## :bulb: How to rotate VM passwords using Github Actions and Azure Key Vault

### Overview

I decided to submit one of my github Actions hacks I did earlier this year as part of this years **ActionsHackathon21** contest.  
In my original post I demonstrate how you can implement a zero-touch fully automated solution under 15 minutes to rotate all our virtual machines local administrator passwords on a schedule by using a Github Actions workflow and a centrally managed Azure key vault. (The technique/concept used in the tutorial is not limited to only Virtual machines. The same concept can be used and applied to almost anything that requires secret rotation)  

Here is the link to the original post, enjoy!
