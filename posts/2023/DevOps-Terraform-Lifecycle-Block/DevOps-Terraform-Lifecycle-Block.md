## Overview

Terraform offers a range of capabilities to handle infrastructure changes in an elegant and controlled manner. One such capability is the **lifecycle** configuration block.

The [lifecycle block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle) provides several meta-arguments to manage how Terraform creates, updates, checks and deletes resources. In this post, we will dive into Terraform's **lifecycle** block and demonstrate its usage with a few examples with **Microsoft Azure resources**.

## Understanding the Lifecycle Block

**Note**: This post was written using **_Terraform (v1.4.x)_**

The **lifecycle** block in Terraform provides control over how a resource is managed. It's a configuration block that is nested within a [resource block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/behavior) and supports four **meta-arguments**:

```hcl
resource "provider_resource" "block" {
  // ... some resource configuration ...

  lifecycle {
    argument = value
  }
}
```

The **lifecycle** block also has an option to configure **custom condition checks** using [preconditions and postconditions](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1.4.x/expressions/custom-conditions#preconditions-and-postconditions):

```hcl
resource "provider_resource" "block" {
  // ... some resource configuration ...

  lifecycle {
    precondition {
      condition = expression
      error_message = "error(string)"
    }

    postcondition {
      condition = expression
      error_message = "error(string)"
    }
  }
}
```

We will take a closer look at **preconditions and postconditions** a bit later, but let's forst look at a few examples using **meta-arguments**:

### 1. Create Before Destroy

**Argument Type**: _Boolean_

In some scenarios, destroying a resource before creating a new one can lead to downtime. To circumvent this, we can set `create_before_destroy` to `true`. This can be particularly useful when working with **Azure Virtual Machines** or **App Services**, where you'd want to minimize downtime.

Here is an example with an Azure Virtual Machine:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_virtual_machine" "example" {
  // ... other configuration ...

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
```

In this scenario, when an update is required that can't be performed in place, Terraform will first create the replacement VM and then destroy the old one, reducing potential downtime.

### 2. Prevent Destroy

**Argument Type**: _Boolean_

### 3. Ignore Changes

**Argument Type**: _list of attribute names_

### 4. Create Before Destroy

**Argument Type**: _list of resource or attribute references_

## Custom Condition Checks

## Conclusion

As you can see the Terraform `lookup()` function can be quite useful in cases where we have multiple sites or different configs and having the ability match and correlate different configurations for different scenarios.

I hope you have enjoyed this post and have learned something new. :heart:
