## Overview - Managing Permissions in GitHub Actions Workflows

In this **GitHub Pro Tips** post we will look at how to manage permissions in GitHub Actions workflows.

GitHub Actions is a powerful tool for automating your CI/CD pipelines/workflows. It allows you to create workflows that can be triggered by events such as a **push** to a repository, a **pull request**, or a **new release**. Workflows are defined in **YAML** files that live in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.

In terms of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), GitHub Actions provides a robust feature set for automating, customizing, and executing your software development workflows right in your repository. Today we will look at the the `permissions` parameter as a groundbreaking feature for constraining the `permissions` provided to the GitHub token.

We will also look at a few practical examples of how and when you would use this feature.

## Conclusion

I hope you have enjoyed this post and have learned something new. :heart:
