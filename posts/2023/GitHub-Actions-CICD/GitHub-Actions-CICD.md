## Overview

Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) is a crucial aspect of modern software development. It involves automating the process of building, testing, and deploying software, allowing teams to release high-quality code more quickly and efficiently. **GitHub Actions** is a popular CI/CD tool that can help automate and streamline these processes. In this blog post, we'll explore how **GitHub Actions** can be used to improve CI/CD, and we'll consider some of the **pros** and **cons** of using this tool as well as **compare** it with another popular CI/CD tool, **Azure DevOps Pipelines**.

## What is GitHub Actions?
