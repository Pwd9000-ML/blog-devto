## What I built

I built and published a community **Codespace** that has an **Azure Pipelines agent** built into the Codespace. The Codespace can register itself via **Codepsace Secrets** as a self-hosted **Azure pipelines agent** into an Azure DevOps **Agent pool**, and be used to run Azure pipelines using the compute power of the Codespace.

### Description

_Use and utelise your codespace compute power to also run a self hosted azure pipelines agent. This devcontainer can be used as a codespace that will create and attach a `self-hosted azure pipelines agent` inside of the codespace and attach/register the ADO agent with an Azure DevOps agent pool by using `secrets for codespaces` as parameter values:_

## Background (What made you decide to build this particular app? What inspired you?)

I wanted a way to be able to **build** as well as **test** my Azure Pipelines (CI/CD) processes, but not have the hassle and costs of building a separate self hosted agent. I wanted to instead use the same **Codespace** I am already working in to also use as my Azure Pipelines Agent.

### How I built it (How did you utilize GitHub Actions or GitHub Codespaces? Did you learn something new along the way? Pick up a new skill?)

I learned how to make community **Codepsaces** to contribute to the wider Dev community and I hope that many others will find my Codespace useful and also contribute to making it even better.
