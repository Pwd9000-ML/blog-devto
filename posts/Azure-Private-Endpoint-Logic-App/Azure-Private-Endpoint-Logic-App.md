## What is Azure Private Link (Private Endpoint)?

[Azure Private Link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-overview) (Private Endpoint) allows you to access Azure PaaS services over a Private IP address within the VNet. The PaaS resource gets a new private IP via a virtual network interface (NIC) on your VNet attached to the PaaS resource, making the PaaS resource truly an internal resource to your network. When you send traffic to the PaaS resource, it will always ensure traffic stays within your VNet boundary.
