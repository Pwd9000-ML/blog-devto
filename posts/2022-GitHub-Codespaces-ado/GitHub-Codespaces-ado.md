## Overview

Welcome to the next part of my series **GitHub Codespaces Pro Tips**, in the last part we spoke a lot about what a **Codespace** is and how to get started with your first **Dev container**.

Since **Codespaces** is a service on **GitHub**, you might be wondering or thinking that the service is limited to **GitHub** customers only. The fact is that **Codespaces** is a service that is linked to a **GitHub** repository, but that is not a limiting factor to be able to use the service in other development platforms such as **Azure DevOps**.

**Azure DevOps** as well as most other popular cloud development platforms allows you to use **Git** repositories hosted on **GitHub** for your source code.  

In todays tutorial I will be showing you how you can create an **Azure DevOps** project using a **Git** repository hosted on **GitHub** and making your first commit using **GitHub Codespaces**.

We will also look at how you can migrate an existing **Git** repository hosted on **Azure DevOps**, to **GitHub**, keeping everything else such as your pipelines, boards and artifacts in **Azure DevOps** but working with the code and repository using **GitHub Codespaces**. Imagine it as a hybrid scenario where you can use the best of both worlds by combining your existing **Azure DevOps** projects and environments to make use of GitHub Codespaces.

## Who can use Codespaces?

## Creating your first CodeSpace

## Customising your CodeSpace

## Examples

I hope you have enjoyed this post and have learned something new. You can also find the code samples used in this blog post on my published [Github](https://github.com/Pwd9000-ML/GitHub-Codespaces-Lab) page. :heart:
