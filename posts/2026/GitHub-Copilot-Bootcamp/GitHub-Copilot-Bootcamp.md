## GitHub Copilot Bootcamp: A Free 4-Week Training Curriculum to Master AI-Powered Development

If you've ever felt overwhelmed by all the features GitHub Copilot offers, or wanted a structured, progressive path to go from "I've heard of Copilot" to "I use it to ship production code faster every single day," then this is for you.

I'm excited to share the **[GitHub Copilot Bootcamp](https://github.com/Pwd9000-ML/GitHub-Copilot-Bootcamp)**, a comprehensive, open-source, 4-week training curriculum I've designed and curated to help developers at any experience level master GitHub Copilot through **hands-on labs, real-world exercises, prompt examples, and weekly reflections**.

The programme is completely free, self-paced, and publicly available as a GitHub template repository so you can fork it, adapt it for your team, or simply work through it on your own.

## Why I Built This Bootcamp

Over the past year, through conference talks, workshops, and community sessions, I noticed a recurring pattern: developers were excited about GitHub Copilot but struggled to move beyond basic code completions. Many didn't know about the different interaction modes (Ask, Edit, Agent, Plan), prompt engineering techniques, or how Copilot can transform DevOps workflows and testing.

I wanted to create something that:

- **Starts from the fundamentals** and progressively builds to advanced techniques
- **Prioritises doing over reading**. Every week includes dedicated hands-on labs
- **Covers the full developer lifecycle**, not just code generation, but testing, DevOps, refactoring, security, and ethics
- **Is easy for teams to adopt**. The repo is a template with a facilitator guide, participant quickstart, and built-in feedback mechanisms

## What You'll Learn: The 4-Week Curriculum

The bootcamp is structured as a progressive learning journey. Each week builds on the previous one, so by the end you'll have a well-rounded mastery of GitHub Copilot across your entire development workflow.

### 📗 Week 1: Introduction and Developer Workflow Essentials

| Prompt Examples | Self-study | Inline completions, debugging, documentation generation patterns |

> **Lab highlight**: You'll work on a practical project, updating the "Mergington High School" extracurricular activities website, using all four interaction modes to solve real problems.

### 📘 Week 2: Advanced Development and Support Use Cases

**Duration**: 2–4 hours | **Objective**: Level up with prompt engineering and customisation

| Module | Duration | What You'll Cover |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prompt Engineering Best Practices | 45–60 min | The CRAFT framework, organisational standards, security recommendations |

| Prompt Examples | Self-study | GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, IaC prompts, security scanning, framework conversion |

> **Lab highlight**: This is where DevOps engineers will feel right at home. You'll use Copilot to generate real CI/CD pipelines, containerisation configs, and comprehensive test suites from scratch.

### 📕 Week 4: Refactoring, Optimisation, and Ethical Practices

**Duration**: 2–2.5 hours | **Objective**: Enhance code quality and adopt responsible AI practices

| Module | Duration | What You'll Cover |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Refactoring Large Codebases | 30–45 min | Legacy code navigation, incremental refactoring, prompting patterns |
| Quality Refinements and Standards | 30–45 min | Enforcing standards via Copilot, instruction files, automated quality checks |
| Ethical and Security Considerations | 30–45 min | IP concerns, security vulnerabilities, responsible AI, organisational compliance |
| **Hands-On Lab** | 45–60 min | Legacy code assessment, incremental refactoring with tests, pair refactoring exercises |
| Prompt Examples | Self-study | Security audit prompts, SOLID principles, bias detection, complete workflow patterns |

> **Lab highlight**: You'll tackle real legacy code, assessing it, documenting it, refactoring it incrementally with test coverage, and running security audits, all guided by Copilot.

## How the Bootcamp Works

### Self-Paced and Flexible

Work through the material at your own pace. Each week is designed as a standalone session of 2–4 hours, but you can split it across multiple sittings. The content is available 24/7 in the GitHub repository.

### Built-In Feedback Loop

Every week includes structured reflection mechanisms:

- **Lab Reflections**: Submit your lab experience via GitHub Issue templates built into the repository
- **Weekly Reflections**: Capture key takeaways and areas for improvement through dedicated issue templates

This isn't just busywork. The reflections help solidify your learning and create a personal record of your Copilot journey.

### Template Repository: Fork and Customise

The repository is set up as a **[GitHub template](https://github.com/Pwd9000-ML/GitHub-Copilot-Bootcamp)**. If you're a team lead, trainer, or community organiser, you can:

1. Click **"Use this template"** to create your own copy
2. Customise the content for your organisation or audience
3. Use the included **[Facilitator Guide](https://github.com/Pwd9000-ML/GitHub-Copilot-Bootcamp/blob/master/FAQ/facilitator-guide.md)** to deliver the training
4. Track participant progress through the built-in feedback issue templates

### Companion Resources

The repo also includes:

- **[IDE Support Guide](https://github.com/Pwd9000-ML/GitHub-Copilot-Bootcamp/blob/master/FAQ/IDE-support.md)**, detailed information on Copilot features per IDE
- **[Participant Quickstart](https://github.com/Pwd9000-ML/GitHub-Copilot-Bootcamp/blob/master/FAQ/participant-quickstart.md)**, a quick reference card to get started immediately
