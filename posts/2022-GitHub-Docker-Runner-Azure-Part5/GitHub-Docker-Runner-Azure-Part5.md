### Overview

All the code used in this tutorial can be found on my GitHub project: [docker-github-runner-linux](https://github.com/Pwd9000-ML/docker-github-runner-linux).

Welcome to Part 5 of my series: **Self Hosted GitHub Runner containers on Azure**.

In the previous part of this series, we looked at how we can use **Azure-CLI** or CI/CD workflows in **GitHub** using **GitHub Actions** to **run** self hosted **GitHub runner** docker containers as **Azure Container Instances (ACI)** in **Azure** from a remote **container registry** also hosted in Azure (ACR).

One of the drawbacks of having self hosted agent runners are if no **GitHub Action Workflows** or **Jobs** are running, the GitHub runner will just sit there idle consuming cost, whether that self hosted **GitHub runner** be an ACI or a docker container hosted on a VM.

So following on from the previous part we will look at how we can use [Azure Container Apps (ACA)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/container-apps/overview) to run images from the remote registry instead and also demonstrate how we can automatically scale our self hosted GitHub runners from **no runners** or **0** up and down based on load/demand, using [Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA)](https://keda.sh/docs/2.7/concepts/).

This will allow us to save on costs and only provision **self hosted GitHub runners** only when needed.

**NOTE**: At the time of this writing Azure Container Apps supports:

- Any **_Linux-based_** x86-64 (linux/amd64) container image.
- Containers from any public or private container registry.
- There are no available [KEDA scalers for GitHub runners](https://keda.sh/docs/2.7/scalers/) at the time of this writing.

### Proof of Concept

Because there are no available [KEDA scalers for GitHub runners](https://keda.sh/docs/2.7/scalers/) at the time of this writing, we will use an **Azure Storage Queue** to control the scaling and provisioning of our self hosted **GitHub runners**.

We'll create the **Container App Environment** and **Azure Queue**, then create an [Azure Queue KEDA Scale Rule](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/scale-app#keda-scalers-conversion) that will have a minimum of **0** and maximum of **3** self hosted runner containers. (It is possible to scale up to a max of **30**).

We'll use the **Azure Queue** to associate **GitHub workflows** as queue messages, to provision/scale self hosted runners using an external GitHub workflow **Job** that will signal KEDA to provision a self hosted runner on the fly to use on any subsequent workflow **Jobs** inside of the **GitHub Workflow**.

After all subsequent workflow **Jobs** have finished running, the queue message associated with the workflow will be removed from the queue and KEDA will scale back down/destroy the self hosted runner container, essentially scaling back down to **0** if there are no other **GitHub workflows** running.

### Pre-Requisites

Things we will need to implement this container app proof of concept:

- Azure Container Apps deployment **Resource Group** (Optional).
- Azure **Container Registry** (ACR) - See [Part3](https://dev.to/pwd9000/storing-docker-based-github-runner-containers-on-azure-container-registry-acr-4om3) of this blog series. (Admin account needs to be enabled).
- **GitHub Service Principal** linked with **Azure** - See [Part3](https://dev.to/pwd9000/storing-docker-based-github-runner-containers-on-azure-container-registry-acr-4om3) of this blog series.
- **Log Analytics Workspace** to link with Azure Container Apps.
- **Azure storage account** and **queue** to be used for scaling with KEDA.
- Azure Container Apps **environment**.
- **Container App** from docker image (self hosted GitHub runner) stored in ACR.

For this step I will use a PowerShell script, [Deploy-ACA.ps1](https://github.com/Pwd9000-ML/docker-github-runner-linux/blob/master/Azure-Pre-Reqs/AzureContainerApps-Queue-Scaler/Deploy-ACA.ps1) running **Azure-CLI**, to create the entire **environment** and **Container App** linked with a target **GitHub Repo** where we will scale runners using KEDA.

```powershell
#Log into Azure
#az login

#Add container app extension to Azure-CLI
az extension add --name containerapp

#Variables (ACA)
$randomInt = Get-Random -Maximum 9999
$region = "uksouth"
$acaResourceGroupName = "Demo-ACA-GitHub-Runners-RG" #Resource group created to deploy ACAs

$acrImage = "$acrLoginServer/pwd9000-github-runner-lin:2.293.0" #Image reference to pull

#Variables (GitHub)

    --sku "Standard_LRS" `
    --kind "StorageV2" `
    --https-only true `
    --min-tls-version "TLS1_2"
$storageConnection = az storage account show-connection-string --resource-group "$acaResourceGroupName" --name "$acaStorageName" --output tsv

```

**NOTES:** Before running the above PowerShell script you will need to enable the **Admin Account** on the **Azure Container Registry** and make a note of the `Username` and `Password` as well as the `LoginSever` and `Image reference` as these needs to be passed as variables in the script:

```powershell
#Variables (ACR) - ACR Admin account needs to be enabled
$acrLoginServer = "registryname.azurecr.io" #The login server name of the ACR (all lowercase). Example: _myregistry.azurecr.io_
$acrUsername = "acrAdminUser" #The Admin Account `Username` on the ACR
$acrPassword = "acrAdminPassword" #The Admin Account `Password` on the ACR
$acrImage = "$acrLoginServer/pwd9000-github-runner-lin:2.293.0" #Image reference to pull
```

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022-GitHub-Docker-Runner-Azure-Part5/assets/acr-admin.png)

You will also need to provide variables for the **GitHub Service Principal/AppName** we created in [Part3](https://dev.to/pwd9000/storing-docker-based-github-runner-containers-on-azure-container-registry-acr-4om3) of the blog series, that is linked with Azure, a **GitHub PAT token** and specify the **Owner** and **Repository** to link with the **Container App**:

```powershell
#Variables (GitHub)
$pat = "ghPatToken" #GitHub PAT token
$githubOrg = "Pwd9000-ML" #GitHub Owner/Org
$githubRepo = "docker-github-runner-linux" #Target GitHub repository to register self hosted runners against
$appName = "GitHub-ACI-Deploy" #Previously created Service Principal linked to GitHub Repo (See part 3 of blog series)
```

See [creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) on how to create a GitHub PAT token. PAT tokens are only displayed once and are sensitive, so ensure they are kept safe.

The minimum permission scopes required on the PAT token to register a self hosted runner are: `"repo"`, `"read:org"`:

### Let's look at what this script created step-by-step

It created a resource group called: **Demo-ACA-GitHub-Runners-RG**, containing the **Azure Container Apps Environment** linked with a **Log Analytics Workspace**, an **Azure Storage Account** and a **Container App** based of a **GitHub runner** image pulled from our **Azure Container Registry**.

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022-GitHub-Docker-Runner-Azure-Part5/assets/rg1.png)

In addition, the GitHub **service principal** created in [Part3](https://dev.to/pwd9000/storing-docker-based-github-runner-containers-on-azure-container-registry-acr-4om3) of this series has also been granted access on the Resource Group as **Contributor** and **Storage Queue Data Contributor** on the storage account we will use for scaling runners.

It also created an empty queue for us **(gh-runner-scaler)**, that we will use to associate running **GitHub Workflows** as queue messages once we start running and scaling **GitHub Action Workflows**.

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022-GitHub-Docker-Runner-Azure-Part5/assets/queue.png)

### Container App

Lets take a deeper look at the created container app itself:

```powershell
#Create Container App from docker image (self hosted GitHub runner) stored in ACR
az containerapp create --resource-group "$acaResourceGroupName" `
    --name "$acaName" `
    --image "$acrImage" `
    --environment "$acaEnvironment" `
    --registry-server "$acrLoginServer" `
    --registry-username "$acrUsername" `
    --registry-password "$acrPassword" `
    --secrets gh-token="$pat" storage-connection-string="$storageConnection" `
    --env-vars GH_OWNER="$githubOrg" GH_REPOSITORY="$githubRepo" GH_TOKEN=secretref:gh-token `
    --cpu "1.75" --memory "3.5Gi" `
    --min-replicas 0 `
    --max-replicas 3
```

As you can see the **Container App** created is scaled at **0-3**, and we do not yet have a scale rule configured:

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022-GitHub-Docker-Runner-Azure-Part5/assets/capp.png)

You'll also notice that the **GitHub** repository we configured as the target to deploy runners to, also has no runners yet, because our scaling is set to **0**:

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022-GitHub-Docker-Runner-Azure-Part5/assets/gh01.png)

If you have been following along this blog series you should know that when we want to provision a self hosted **GitHub runner** using the image we created, through docker or as an ACI, we had to pass in some environment variables such as: **GH_OWNER**, **GH_REPOSITORY** and **GH_TOKEN** to specify which repo the runners needs to be registered on.

You'll notice that these variables are stored inside of the **Container App** configuration:

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022-GitHub-Docker-Runner-Azure-Part5/assets/env.png)

Notice that the **GH_TOKEN** is actually referenced by a **secret**:

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022-GitHub-Docker-Runner-Azure-Part5/assets/secenv2.png)

The script also sets the **Azure Queue Storage Account Connection String** as a secret, because we will need this to set up our KEDA scale rule next.

### Create a scale rule

Next we will create a KEDA scaling rule. In the Azure portal navigate to the **Container App**. Go to `'Scale'` and click on `'Edit and deploy'`:

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022-GitHub-Docker-Runner-Azure-Part5/assets/scale01.png)

Then click on the `'Scale'` tab and select `'+ Add'`:

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022-GitHub-Docker-Runner-Azure-Part5/assets/scale02.png)

This will bring up the scaling rule configuration pane. Fill out the following:

| Key | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Rule Name` | `'queue-scaling'` | Name for scale rule |
| `Type` | `'Azure queue'` | Type of scaler to use |
| `Queue name` | `'gh-runner-scaler'` | Azure storage queue name created by script |
| `Queue length` | `'1'` | Trigger threshold (Each workflow run) |

Then click on `'+ Add'` on the **Authentication** section.

Under `'Secret reference'` you will see a drop down to select the `'storage-connection-string'` secret we created earlier. For the `'Trigger parameter'` type `'connection'`.

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022-GitHub-Docker-Runner-Azure-Part5/assets/scale03.png)

Then click on `'Add'` and `'Create'`. After a minute you will see the new scale rule have been created:

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022-GitHub-Docker-Runner-Azure-Part5/assets/scale04.png)

**NOTE:** When you create the scale rule for the first time, when the container app is being provisioned, you will notice there will be a short lived runner that will appear on the GitHub repo. The reason for this is that the provisioning process will provision at least 1x instance momentarily and then scale down to **0** after about 5 minutes.

### Running and Scaling Workflows

Next we will create a **GitHub workflow** that will use an external **Job** to associate our **workflow run** with an **Azure Queue message**, that will automatically trigger KEDA to provision a self hosted runner inside of our repo for any subsequent workflow **Jobs**.

As you can see, we currently have no self hosted runners on our GitHub repository:

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022-GitHub-Docker-Runner-Azure-Part5/assets/gh01.png)

You can use the following example workflow: [kedaScaleTest.yml](https://github.com/Pwd9000-ML/docker-github-runner-linux/blob/master/.github/workflows/kedaScaleTest.yml)

```yml
name: KEDA Scale self hosted

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

env:
  AZ_STORAGE_ACCOUNT: aca2keda2scaler126
  AZ_QUEUE_NAME: gh-runner-scaler

jobs:
  #External Job to create and associate workflow with a unique QueueId on Azure queue to scale up KEDA
  scale-keda-queue-up:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: 'Login via Azure CLI'
        uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

      - name: scale up self hosted
        id: scaleJob
        run: |
          OUTPUT=$(az storage message put --queue-name "${{ env.AZ_QUEUE_NAME }}" --content "${{ github.run_id }}" --account-name "${{ env.AZ_STORAGE_ACCOUNT }}")
          echo "::set-output name=scaleJobId::$(echo "$OUTPUT" | grep "id" | sed 's/^.*: //' | sed 's/,*$//g')"
          echo "::set-output name=scaleJobPop::$(echo "$OUTPUT" | grep "popReceipt" | sed 's/^.*: //' | sed 's/,*$//g')"
    outputs:
      scaleJobId: ${{ steps.scaleJob.outputs.scaleJobId }}
      scaleJobPop: ${{ steps.scaleJob.outputs.scaleJobPop }}

  #Subsequent Jobs runs-on [self-hosted]. Job1, Job2, JobN etc etc
  testRunner:
    needs: scale-keda-queue-up
    runs-on: [self-hosted]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2
      - name: Display Terraform Version
        run: terraform --version
      - name: Display Azure-CLI Version
        run: az --version
      - name: Delay runner finish (5min)
        run: sleep 5m

      #Remove unique QueueId on Azure queue associated with workflow as final step to scale down KEDA
      - name: 'Login via Azure CLI'
        uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

      - name: scale down self hosted
        run: |
          az storage message delete --id "${{needs.scaleJob.outputs.scaleJobId}}" --pop-receipt "${{needs.scaleJob.outputs.scaleJobPop}}" --queue-name "${{ env.AZ_QUEUE_NAME }}" --account-name "${{ env.AZ_STORAGE_ACCOUNT }}"
```

**NOTE:** On the above **GitHub workflow**, replace the environment variables with your **Azure Storage Account** and **Queue** name:

```yml
env:
  AZ_STORAGE_ACCOUNT: aca2keda2scaler126
  AZ_QUEUE_NAME: gh-runner-scaler
```

### Let's take a look at what this workflow does step-by-step

### Job 1

```yml
jobs:
  #External Job to create and associate workflow with a unique QueueId on Azure queue to scale up KEDA
  scale-keda-queue-up:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: 'Login via Azure CLI'
        uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

      - name: scale up self hosted
        id: scaleJob
        run: |
          OUTPUT=$(az storage message put --queue-name "${{ env.AZ_QUEUE_NAME }}" --content "${{ github.run_id }}" --account-name "${{ env.AZ_STORAGE_ACCOUNT }}")
          echo "::set-output name=scaleJobId::$(echo "$OUTPUT" | grep "id" | sed 's/^.*: //' | sed 's/,*$//g')"
          echo "::set-output name=scaleJobPop::$(echo "$OUTPUT" | grep "popReceipt" | sed 's/^.*: //' | sed 's/,*$//g')"
    outputs:
      scaleJobId: ${{ steps.scaleJob.outputs.scaleJobId }}
      scaleJobPop: ${{ steps.scaleJob.outputs.scaleJobPop }}
```

The first **Job** called **scale-keda-queue-up:**, will use an external runner to send a queue message to the **Azure Queue** and then save the unique **Queue Id** and **Queue popReceipt** as an output that we can later reference in other **Jobs**. This unique queue message will represent the workflow run:

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022-GitHub-Docker-Runner-Azure-Part5/assets/q01.png)

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022-GitHub-Docker-Runner-Azure-Part5/assets/q02.png)

KEDA will see this queue message based on the scale rule we created earlier and then automatically provision a **GitHub self hosted runner** for this repo whilst the queue has messages:

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022-GitHub-Docker-Runner-Azure-Part5/assets/runner01.png)

Notice if we run a few more workflows, whilst the current workflow is running using th same technique, more messages will appear on the **azure queue**:

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022-GitHub-Docker-Runner-Azure-Part5/assets/q03.png)

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022-GitHub-Docker-Runner-Azure-Part5/assets/q04.png)

These queue messages which represents our workflows will automatically cause KEDA to scale up and create more self hosted runners on our repository based on the demand/load of workflows running. Essentially KEDA is dynamically scaling up our self hosted runners as more workflows runs simultaneously based on demand:

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022-GitHub-Docker-Runner-Azure-Part5/assets/runner02.png)

### Job 2 <-> Job n

Any subsequent jobs on the workflow can use the self hosted runner as we can see from the following Job on the workflow as it is set to `'runs-on: [self-hosted]'`:

```yml
#Subsequent Jobs runs-on [self-hosted]. Job1, Job2, JobN etc etc
testRunner:
  needs: scale-keda-queue-up
  runs-on: [self-hosted]
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Install Terraform
      uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2
    - name: Display Terraform Version
      run: terraform --version
    - name: Display Azure-CLI Version
      run: az --version
    - name: Delay runner finish (5min)
      run: sleep 5m

    #Remove unique QueueId on Azure queue associated with workflow as final step to scale down KEDA
    - name: 'Login via Azure CLI'
      uses: azure/login@v1
      with:
        creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

    - name: scale down self hosted
      run: |
        az storage message delete --id "${{needs.scaleJob.outputs.scaleJobId}}" --pop-receipt "${{needs.scaleJob.outputs.scaleJobPop}}" --queue-name "${{ env.AZ_QUEUE_NAME }}" --account-name "${{ env.AZ_STORAGE_ACCOUNT }}"
```

This second **Job** (or any subsequent jobs) in our workflow run (associated with a unique queue message), can now use and run on the self hosted **GitHub runner** that KEDA scaled up on the **Azure Container Apps** and installs **Terraform** as well as display the version of **Terraform** and **Azure-CLI**.

The last step on the final workflow **Job** called **scale down self hosted**, is simply used to remove the unique queue message associated with the workflow run on the **azure queue** to signal that the workflow is completed. This will cause KEDA to scale back down and if there are no more workflows running KEDA can scale back down to **0**:

```yml
- name: scale down self hosted
    run: |
    az storage message delete --id "${{needs.scaleJob.outputs.scaleJobId}}" --pop-receipt "${{needs.scaleJob.outputs.scaleJobPop}}" --queue-name "${{ env.AZ_QUEUE_NAME }}" --account-name "${{ env.AZ_STORAGE_ACCOUNT }}"
```

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022-GitHub-Docker-Runner-Azure-Part5/assets/q05.png)

Once all workflow runs are finished and the **Azure Queue** is cleared, you'll notice that KEDA has scaled back down and our self hosted runners have also been cleaned up and removed from the repo:

![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/main/posts/2022-GitHub-Docker-Runner-Azure-Part5/assets/gh01.png)

### Conclusion

As you can see it was pretty easy to provision an **Azure Container Apps** environment and create a **Container App** and **KEDA** scale rule using **azure queues** to automatically provision self hosted **GitHub runners** onto a repository of our choice that has **0** or **no** runners at all.

There are a few caveats and pain points I would like to highlight in this proof of concept, and hopefully these will be improved as the Container App product matures. Once these pain points have been addressed, I will create another part to this blog series highlighting these improvements.

**Issue 1**: Azure Container Apps doesn't fully yet allow us to use the **Container Apps system assigned managed identity** to pull images from **Azure Container Registry**. This means that we have to enable the ACRs **Admin Account** in order to provision images from the Azure Container Registry. You can follow this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-container-apps/issues/268) regarding this bug.

**Issue 2**: As mentioned earlier, there are no available [KEDA scalers for GitHub runners](https://keda.sh/docs/2.7/scalers/) at the time of this writing. This means that we have to utilise an **Azure Storage Queue** with our **GitHub workflows** to provision/scale runners with KEDA using an external **GitHub workflow Job** sending a queue message (representing our workflow run) for KEDA to be signalled to provision a self hosted runner on the fly for us to use on subsequent **Workflow Jobs**.

One benefit of this method however is that we can have a minimum container count of **0**, which means we won't ever have any idle runners doing nothing consuming unnecessary costs, thus essentially only paying for self hosted runners when they are actually **running**. This method will only create self hosted GitHub runners based on the **Azure Queue length** essentially associating our workflow run with a queue item.

Once the **GitHub Workflow** finishes it will remove the queue item and KEDA will scale back down to **0** if there are no **GitHub workflows** running.

That concludes this five part series where we took a deep dive in detail on how to implement **Self Hosted GitHub Runner containers on Azure**.
