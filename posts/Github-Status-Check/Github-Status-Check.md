You can check the status of github in real-time, incl. historical data on system performance, follow incidents or scheduled maintenance by going to: [https://www.githubstatus.com/](https://www.githubstatus.com/).  

![gh_status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/master/posts/Github-Status-Check/assets/gh_status.png)

Similarly to check the status of Azure DevOps you can use: [https://status.dev.azure.com/](https://status.dev.azure.com/).  

![ado_status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwd9000-ML/blog-devto/master/posts/Github-Status-Check/assets/ado_status.png)

Both status pages also has an RSS feed. In my next article/tutorial I will show how to create an Azure Logic App that will notify you when any of the services become degraded.
