## Overview

In this session we will look at how you can automate and maintain your terraform module versioning using a dependency management tool originally ported from the **GitHub Security Toolset** called **[Dependabot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tingle-software.dependabot)** in **Azure DevOps** and how to easily update your terraform modules to the latest version using **Azure DevOps** pipelines.  

**Dependabot** is an invaluable tool for managing **Terraform** infrastructure-as-code projects. It helps maintain your Terraform modules at their latest versions. It systematically scans your `*.tf` files, identifies dependencies (i.e., modules and Terraform providers), and checks for any new updates or releases available.  

When **Dependabot** identifies an outdated Terraform module or provider, it automatically creates a pull request in your version control system with the updated version, we will look how to set this automated check and **Pull Requests** up using **Azure DevOps Pipelines**. These pull requests include change logs and compatibility scores, just like any other Dependabot update. This automated process ensures your infrastructure's configuration is always up-to-date and reduces the risks associated with outdated modules or providers. Furthermore, Dependabot simplifies the process of managing multiple dependencies, making it significantly effortless and more efficient for developers to maintain a healthy Terraform codebase.
