An improved connection experience is available in the Windows App, in preview, offering quick access to Dev Box in the taskbar and seamless transition between Dev Box and Windows devices. For enterprise management, Dev Box connection telemetry is now generally available through Azure Monitor, providing insights into performance and system events.

Additionally, a hibernation feature on disconnect helps optimise costs by letting dev boxes hibernate when there is no active remote desktop protocol session. The updates also introduce the ability for developer tool vendors to create and publish Dev Box-compatible custom images via the "Windows client for developers" image in the Azure Marketplace, and new deployment regions have been added to improve connectivity performance and latency.

### 11. Azure Deployment Environments: Extending Support for Pulumi

Microsoft Azure Deployment Environments are enhancing their extensibility model to include support for Pulumi, alongside existing support for Arm, Bicep, and Terraform. This update allows customers to perform deployments using Pulumi, a popular Infrastructure as Code (IaC) framework, enabling more flexible and efficient infrastructure management.

Customers can either build their own container image following published guidance or directly utilise a sample container image published for Pulumi. Additionally, a quick-start template is available for platform engineers to deploy and configure Azure Deployment Environments with a single-click deployment, streamlining the setup process and promoting a more seamless experience for leveraging IaC frameworks within Azure.

### 12. GitHub Copilot Extensions: Enhancing Developer Experience with Azure

My Personal favourite announcements is GitHub is launching the first set of GitHub Copilot extensions in private preview, developed by Microsoft and third-party partners. These extensions allow developers and organisations to tailor their GitHub Copilot experience with their preferred services, such as Azure, Docker, Sentry, and more, directly within GitHub Copilot Chat.

Specifically, the GitHub Copilot for Azure extension enables developers to build, troubleshoot, and deploy applications on Azure more efficiently. This showcases the potential of building in natural language and demonstrates how a broader range of capabilities can significantly accelerate development velocity.
